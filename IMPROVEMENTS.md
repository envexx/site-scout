# AI Response Formatting Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the AI response formatting system to provide better structure, readability, and styling for agent responses.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Instructions
Updated all API prompts in `api_handler.js` to include specific formatting requirements:

- **Main Titles**: Use `[JUDUL UTAMA]` format for main sections
- **Sub Titles**: Use `(Sub Judul)` format for categories like "Type:", "Main Topic:", "Target Audience:"
- **Bullet Points**: Use `-` for lists and key points
- **Line Breaks**: Only use line breaks for bullet points, not for regular text
- **Structured Sections**: Organize responses with clear sections: `[OVERVIEW]`, `[KEY HIGHLIGHTS]`, `[QUICK INSIGHTS]`

### 2. Enhanced Response Parsing
Improved the `formatAgentResult` function in `popup.js` to support both old and new formats:

- **Dual Format Support**: Recognizes both emoji-based (üéØüìùüí°) and bracket-based ([OVERVIEW]) formats
- **Flexible Matching**: Uses regex patterns that work with multiple formatting styles
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for existing response formats

### 3. Advanced Title Detection
New `detectAndFormatTitles` function provides intelligent title formatting:

- **Main Section Titles**: Large headings with bottom borders for major sections
- **Sub Section Titles**: Medium headings with left borders for subsections
- **Category Labels**: Styled badges for Type, Main Topic, Target Audience, etc.
- **Smart Styling**: Different visual treatments based on title importance

### 4. Enhanced Bullet Point Detection
New `detectAndFormatBulletPoints` function provides sophisticated list formatting:

- **Multiple Bullet Styles**: Supports `-`, `‚Ä¢`, `*`, and numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.)
- **Intelligent Grouping**: Automatically groups consecutive bullet points into proper `<ul>` tags
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains proper spacing and formatting between lists and text
- **Clean Output**: Removes empty lists and improves overall readability

### 5. Improved Fallback Formatting
Enhanced `enhancedFallbackFormatting` function for better text processing:

- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically detects and formats various content types
- **Consistent Styling**: Applies uniform visual treatment across all content
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles malformed or unexpected content
- **Performance**: Efficient processing with minimal overhead

## Technical Implementation

### File Changes
- `src/lib/api_handler.js`: Updated all prompt functions with formatting requirements

### New Functions Added
1. `detectAndFormatTitles()`: Handles title and subtitle formatting
2. `detectAndFormatBulletPoints()`: Manages bullet point detection and formatting
3. `enhancedFallbackFormatting()`: Provides improved fallback text processing

### Enhanced Functions
1. `formatAgentResult()`: Now supports multiple format types
2. `extractOverviewContent()`: Enhanced regex patterns for better content extraction
3. `extractHighlightsContent()`: Improved bullet point detection
4. `extractInsightsContent()`: Better content boundary detection
